Payroll Management System

Background
Problem Statement: XYZ Tech IT services has an old Payroll Management System where Employees make manual attendance and get hard-copies of Pay-slips and Tax-slips from the Accounts Department and thus Employees didnâ€™t receive benefits in taxes through different modes of Allowances instantly.
Solution: To maintain the prestige and reputation in the Technology market, the company has planned to upgrade its Payroll Management System, this will enable efficiently accurate recording and hassle-free for their payroll department. The new Payroll Management System will include - Paid Leaves, Taxes, Medical expenses, working and non-working dates, bonuses irrespective of different Departments in just one click. All the Employees will get default credentials to access the new Payroll system to get hassle-free Salary slips anytime and everywhere.
